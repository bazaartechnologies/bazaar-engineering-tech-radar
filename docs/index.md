# Welcome to Bazaar Tech Radar

The Bazaar Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams to pick the best technologies for new projects. It provides a platform to share knowledge and experience about technologies, techniques, tools, and platforms.

## What is a Tech Radar?

The Tech Radar is a visual document that shows the current technology landscape for our organization. It's based on the pioneering work by ThoughtWorks and consists of:

### Four Quadrants:

- **Techniques**: Methods, practices, and approaches to software development
- **Tools**: Software development tools, testing frameworks, and utilities
- **Platforms**: Infrastructure, cloud services, and runtime environments
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Programming languages and application frameworks

### Four Rings:

- **Adopt**: Technologies we have high confidence in and recommend for widespread use
- **Trial**: Technologies that are ready for use but haven't been proven at scale yet
- **Assess**: Technologies worth exploring to understand their potential impact
- **Hold**: Technologies we recommend proceeding with caution or avoiding

2. **Browse Technologies**: Explore technologies by quadrant in the navigation menu
3. **Learn How to Contribute**: Read the [guide](guide.md) on how to add or update technologies

## How We Use It

The Tech Radar reflects our collective technology strategy and helps teams make informed decisions about:

- Which technologies to adopt for new projects
- Which technologies to invest time in learning
- Which technologies to phase out or avoid

The radar is a living document that evolves as we gain experience and as the technology landscape changes.
