# Python

## Description

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for web development, data science, automation, and more.

## Why Adopt?

We have adopted Python as one of our primary backend languages because:

- **Productivity**: Clean syntax enables rapid development
- **Ecosystem**: Rich library ecosystem (Django, Flask, FastAPI, pandas, numpy)
- **Versatility**: Works well for APIs, data processing, scripting, and ML
- **Talent Pool**: Large community and readily available skilled developers
- **Proven Track Record**: Successfully used in multiple production services

## Our Experience

Python powers several critical services in our infrastructure:

- Main API backend (FastAPI)
- Data processing pipelines
- Internal automation tools
- Machine learning models

The team has strong expertise in Python development and we've established clear patterns and best practices.

## Recommendations

- **Use FastAPI** for new API services (high performance, automatic OpenAPI docs)
- **Use Poetry** for dependency management
- **Follow PEP 8** style guidelines
- **Write type hints** for better code quality and IDE support
- **Use pytest** for testing
- **Consider async/await** for I/O-bound operations
